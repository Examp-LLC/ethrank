                <p><strong>1.3 Ownership of Creative Materials. </strong></p>
                <p>You acknowledge and agree that Issuer (or, as applicable,
                  its licensors) own all rights, title and interest in and to any artwork, designs, drawings, photographs,
                  labels, logos, insignia, trademarks, trade dress, copyright, recipes, formulas and other creative
                  materials that may be associated with any NFT that you Own (collectively, &#34;Creative Materials&#34;),
                  and all intellectual property rights therein. The rights that you have in and to the Creative Materials
                  are limited to those expressly stated below, under &#34;Intellectual Property Ownership, Licenses and
                  Restrictions.&#34; Notwithstanding any purchase of NFTs, all right, title, and interest in the Issuer
                  Intellectual Property (as defined below), including the Creative Materials and other Issuer
                  Intellectual Property incorporated in any NFTs (including NFTs that you Own) and including all
                  copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein, are held by Issuer or its
                  licensors, and you agree not to infringe, violate or misappropriate those exclusive rights.</p>
                <p><strong>1.4 Risks of NFTs. </strong></p>
                <p>Once you Own any NFT, you are responsible for any loss or damage to, or
                  loss of access to, the NFT and neither Issuer nor any of its licensors shall have any liability in such
                  circumstances, regardless of cause. You expressly understand and agree that your use of the
                  Platform and any NFTs is at your sole risk and that the Platform and NFTs are provided &#34;as is&#34;
                  and &#34;as available.&#34; </p>
                <p><strong>1.5 Terms of Sale.  </strong></p>
                <p>All sales of NFTs are final.  Once you have made a purchase of an NFT, you should promptly take the necessary steps to complete your transaction (e.g., activate or download any content or secure any seed phrase or corresponding private key).  We encourage the use of secure, offline storage measures for NFTs. You may purchase NFTs using real or virtual/cryptocurrency, where multiple payment options are made available to you. You may resell or otherwise transfer an NFT that you Own where this is permitted by these NFT Terms and applicable law.  Any sale or transfer must provide for the transfer of all of your rights then outstanding with respect to such NFT.  Anyone receiving such NFTs from you agrees to and is bound by these NFT Terms.  You are strictly forbidden to sell, swap, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your purchased NFT to any person who is not twenty-one (21) years or older.  We expressly reserve the right to seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any NFT in case of non-compliance with the foregoing.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>You acknowledge that NFTs carry the following risks among others.  We expressly disclaim any responsibility for these risks.
                </p>
                <p><strong>6.1 Inherent Risks with Digital Assets</strong></p>
                <p>There are risks associated with using Internet-based digital assets such as NFTs and cryptocurrency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum blockchain network, however caused. </p>

                <p><strong>6.2 Value/Volatility/Not An Investment</strong></p>
                <p>The prices of NFTs can be extremely volatile and subjective, and NFTs have no inherent or intrinsic value. To the extent there is a price or market for a blockchain asset such as an NFT, (a) those prices and markets are extremely volatile, (b) variations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of any digital assets you own, including NFTs, and (c) there is no guarantee that NFTs will have or retain any value.  NFTs are not securities or financial instruments and are not offered for investment purposes.  The commercial or market value of NFTs may materially diminish in value as a result of a variety of things, including negative publicity associated with Issuer.  You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for the risks of engaging in any transactions relating to your NFTs with third parties (e.g., transferring your NFT from a third party on any so-called &#34;secondary market&#34;).</p>
                <p><strong>6.3 Use of Blockchain.</strong></p>
                <p>The Platform does not store, send, or receive NFTs. This is because NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Platform&#39;s supporting blockchain in the Ethereum blockchain network. Any transfer of NFTs occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Network, and not on the Platform. We do not make any promises or guarantees about the availability of NFTs or that it will host your or any other NFTs at any specific location and/or for any specific period of time.  Upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain, a hard fork or other change to the Ethereum blockchain, a failure or cessation of the Ethereum blockchain or its underlying cryptocurrency, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using those or similar technologies, including the NFTs.  We do not make any promises or guarantees related to the Ethereum Foundation, the Ethereum blockchain, or any other third parties related to the NFTs or the Platform (including any of their respective applications and/or services, as well as to the continued availability of or the protection or storage of any data you provide to those parties).  You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any loss of access to your NFTs due to loss of your private key(s), custodial error or purchaser error, mining attacks, hacking, security weaknesses, fraud, counterfeiting, cyberattacks and other technological difficulties.</p>
                <p><strong>6.4 Regulatory Uncertainty</strong></p>
                <p>The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Platform ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of your NFTs.  You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for the risk of changes to the regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens and new regulations, unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions or policies any of which may materially adversely affect the use and value of the NFTs.</p>
                <p><strong>6.5 Tax Calculations.</strong></p>
                <p>You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your NFT-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the Platform or other NFT-related transactions.
                </p>
                <p><strong>6.6 General</strong></p>
                <p>You also acknowledge and agree that: (a) you have obtained sufficient information to make an informed decision regarding the NFTs; (b) you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability and appropriateness of these risks for yourself; (c) Issuer does not represent or warrant that any NFTs, or its supporting systems or technology, are reliable, current or error-free or otherwise meets your requirements, that defects in the NFTs, or their supporting systems or technology, will be corrected, or that the delivery mechanism for NFTs will be free of viruses or other harmful components; and (d) Issuer shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors or delays you may experience related to the NFTs.

You shall not export, re-export, or otherwise transfer or provide any Item in contravention of any Trade Control Law, including to anyone (a) in Cuba, Crimea, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria, or in any other embargoed destination, or (b) listed on, or owned or controlled by anyone on, a sanctioned party list published by the U.S. Departments of Commerce or Treasury, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (a &#34;Sanctioned Party&#34;).  You certify that you are not a Sanctioned Party or located in or a resident of any embargoed destination.  In addition to any other remedy that Issuer may have, Issuer may suspend and/or cancel the provision of any Item if Issuer believes, in its discretion, that such activity may violate any Trade Control Law or Issuer&#39;s own compliance policies.</p>
