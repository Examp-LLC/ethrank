          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>progress</td>
            <td>A string array mapping to the indexes of the steps, goals and achievements in the <a href="https://github.com/Examp-LLC/ethrank/blob/main/lib/achievements_season2.json">JSON definition</a> for the current season.<br /><br />
              Example: <strong>000</strong><br />
